### Task

Write a Java application called **ConvertTemperature.java** which declares and initialises a temperature in centigrade and calculates and outputs the equivalent temperature in fahrenheit. 

The formula for conversion is:

**fahrenheit = 9/5 * centigrade + 32**

Your output should have the following format:

100.00 degrees centigrade = 212.00 degrees Fahrenheit
